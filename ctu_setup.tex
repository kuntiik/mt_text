\begin{abstract-english}
Dental caries is the most prevalent disease in the world with more than 3.5 billion people affected. The treatment of dental caries imposes a burden on health care in every country financially and timewise. Detection of the disease in its early stages can mitigate the impact on the cost of treatment and improve the patient's prognosis.

Bitewing X-ray imaging is after the visual-tactile method the second most method used for dental caries detection. An-early stage carious lesson can be easily overlooked by the visuale-tactile exam, making the bitewing X-ray imaging very beneficial for an early detection and a chance for a recovery without the need for a further dental treatment.

This Master's thesis addresses the problem of dental caries detection from bitewing images using convolutional neural networks. First, a dataset of 3889 bitewing images with 7257 annotated dental caries was created for the purpose of this thesis. Using it, we trained multiple architectures for object detection and compared their performance. In the end, we used an ensemble of models to obtain the best-performing model


We have created a solution that can detect dental caries with a precision of 0.751 and a recall of 0.7. Furthermore, second model for segmentation of dental restoration was created, achieving an IOU score of 0.676.

\begin{thanks}
    Firstly, I would like to express gratitude to prof. Jan Kybic for supervision of this thesis and his willingness to help at any time.
    \medskip

    Secondly, I would like to thank MDDr. Tichý was always eager to help, and without his dedication to creating the dataset, we would not have achieved the results we did.
    \medskip

    Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for their support during my studies.
    \medskip

    I would like to further emphasize my gratitude to my girlfriend Anna for her undying moral and encouragement throughout the creation of this thesis.
